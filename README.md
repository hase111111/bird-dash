## Description

Bird Dash! is a 3D action game created with Unreal Engine 5.

The player controls a bird character and the objective is to advance to the goal while avoiding obstacles.
The bird continues to move forward without the player's control, so the player must look ahead and avoid obstacles to the left and right.
Obstacles are not only static, such as thorns and rocks, but also dynamic ones, such as cannons and animals, which can attack the player.
If you hit an obstacle or fall, you make a mistake and have to start the stage over again from the beginning.

Heart-shaped items are placed in the middle of the stage, and by taking these items, a new stage will be released.
The hearts are generally placed in difficult-to-get locations, so the player is required to observe the stage carefully and aim to get them.

There are 12 stages + 2 secret stages (Stage 1-1 to Stage 3-4 + Stage 4-1 to Stage 4-2) in total, and each stage has a different theme.
